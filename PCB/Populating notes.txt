                                      Hand Reflow Soldering
                                      ==== ====== =========

If using a frying pan for home reflow soldering, it is best to leave the bypass resistors off and
place them by hand after the main red-side components. Also leave off C3 (nearest the processor)
and the fuse. (C3 interferes with soldering and even inspecting processor pins 13-16.)

On two pin devices, apply paste towards the middle of the component (away from the ends). There
two exceptions: D6 (Schottly diode), and C6 (electrolytic on the blue side of the boards).

For reflowing bypass resistors and LEDs, use a medium nozzle, 260^C temperature, and the lowest
fan setting.

For LEDs, centre the nozzle over the LEDs, use 5 mm distance, and wait until the
solder paste goes shiny and shrinks to just the pads.

For bypass resistors, the fan speed can be increased to 4 (of 8 on an Atten 858D+). The nozzle
can be moved to one end if the other end melts first, attempting to keep the nozzle centred the
instant that the resistor is seen to move.

For the electrolytic capacitor, don't use a heat gun but use a soldering iron instead. Ensure
that there is plenty of paste on the pads, including (mainly for these only) at the ends of the
pads.

To quickly test the bypass resistors before the processors are working: on the red side, measure
resistance from the fuse pad furthest from D1 to both of the bypass resistor pads nearest D1
(they both connect to net BypR). It should read 3.3 ohms. If not, use the vias in the outboard
bypass resistor area; these should read about 4.1 ohms to either VDD or BypR.

A quick test for the electrolytic capacitor C6: Fluke 87 III multimeter locked to 400 kOhm range,
positive probe to the via near the C of Coulomb on the red side, negative end on the square
(inner of 2, marked - on the other side) terminal of TX (north east corner). The resistance
should increase about 10 kOhms per second.

The yellow LED cannot easily be tested without the processor. The blue/red LED can, with a good
multimeter, negative probe towards the bypass resistor. If the red LED lights only very dimly,\
with around 1.2 V reading instead of the expected almost 1.7 V, suspect soldering near processor
pin 11. Note that unpowered LED tests are impractical once the farad capactitor is installed.
