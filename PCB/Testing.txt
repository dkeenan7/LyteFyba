                           Testing Procedure for New BMUs
                           ==============================

1) Prepare the power supply with about 3.58 V and perhaps 1A of current limit.
2) Connect power to each BMU. Have a multimeter on 10A range monitoring current. As each BMU is clipped on,
it should draw around 0.25 A charging the supercapacitor. If the red LED lights, suspect a short from pins 1 to 4
of the LED.
3) For each BMU, JTAG the debugger program into it. For maximum speed, use ^D to start the debugger and
flash the chip, use mouse button hovered over the break toolbar button (hand icon) to break, note 0x10FF going
from $86 to $06, use Ctrl-shift-D to exit the debugger. The memory window should be open at $10F0.
4) When all 8 BMUs are flashed, connect comms and run TeraTerm. Often, comms won't get through all the boards
(no echo on Teraterm). Use Del chars and see how far the blue flashes go. Use "u" chars and a DSO on the north west
corner of the opto to make sure the comms chars look clean and slightly rounded.
