                           Testing Procedure for New BMUs
                           ==============================


0) Prepare the power supply with between 3.40 and 3.48 V and about 1A of current
limit. Have a multimeter on 10A range monitoring current. Set DSO to 1V/Div,
100uS/div, normal trigger, trigger at about 1.7 V.
1) Connect power to each BMU. As each BMU is clipped on, it should draw around
0.25 A charging the supercapacitor, but it's not worth looking for this. If the
red LED lights, suspect a short from pins 1 to 4 of the LED.
2) For each BMU, check the voltage across the JTAG port. It should read between
2.47 and 2.53 V.
3) For each BMU, JTAG the debugger program into it. Use ^D to start the debugger
and flash the chip. The memory window should be open at $10F0; note $86 or $87
at 0x10FF. Start the program (F5), break. Keyboard users should use the mouse
button hovered over the break toolbar button (hand icon), since there is no
keyboard command for break.Note 0x10FF going to $06. Re-run the program, and
exit the debugger  (Ctrl-shift-D). 
4) When all 8 BMUs are JTAGed, connect comms and run TeraTerm. Sometimes, comms
won't get through all the boards (no echo on Teraterm). Use Del chars and see how
far the blue flashes go. Whether you get echo or not, use "U" chars and a DSO on
the north west corner of the opto to make sure the comms chars look clean and
slightly rounded.
5) When you get echo, use the I command to set the IDs. Send the 0'lw command to
turn on link voltage measurement for all BMUs, if needed. IMPORTANT: use the 'u'
command to update these changes.
6) Use the v command to check that the last ID is correct, and that all blue LEDs
are working. 
7) For each BMU:
  a) Use the <nn>x command to address the BMU on its own
  b) Use the v command to verify that only the current BMU's blue light comes on.
     If not, escape enter and re-do the x command.
  c) Use the <nnnn>'vc command to calibrate the voltage. Check that the calibration
     value is in the ranges -31500 to -32768 or 31500 to 32767. Check the voltage
     reading with 'v'.
  d) Use the <nn>'tc command to calibrate the temperature. Check with 't'.
  e) Use the l command to read link voltage; it should read 1500 +- 100. You may
     need 0p.
  f) Short the LI (Link In) pin to ground and run another l command. It should
     read -500 +- 100.
  g) Use 1y to turn on bypass. Current should go to 0.35-0.39 A, yellow LED should
     light.
  h) Use 0y1e to turn on error. Red LED should light, piezo should sound.
  i) If the piezo is too quiet, use the 'o' command to change octaves. Repeat if
     necessary. Use 0e to turn off the error alarm.
  j) Update with the 'u' command. Note: there will probably be some strange
     characters emitted as following BMUs are reset.
  k) Type ESC to exit the x command (actually only for BMUs before the
     currently updated one).
8) Test the break on reset with 1e then alt-B (send break)
9) Turn off the power supply; use 1e to discharge the supercaps (will take
minutes).
