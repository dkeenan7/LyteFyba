                      Testing Procedure for CMUs and BMU
                      ==================================

If a CMU fails any test, put a coloured sticker on it with the number and letter 
of the step it failed.


0) Prepare the power supply with between 3.42 V and 3.48 V with its current
   limit set to about 3 A.
   Use the ammeter on the power supply to monitor supply current.
   Use the Fluke 87 III multimeter to monitor supply voltage by plugging its leads
   into the white connector on the test jig.
   Set oscilloscope to 1 V/div, 100 us/div, normal trigger, trigger at about 1.7 V.
   Launch the IAR Workbench software. Open its celltopbmu.eww workspace and
   choose the TestICal project and connect the Launch Pad programming device to the
   right hand USB port.
   Launch TeraTerm and connect the Novus RS485 device to the left hand USB port.
1) Place the board to be tested with its beepers up and with the
   "Lyte Fyba" text reading the right way 'round.
   Connect the communications plugs (in and out) to the pairs of holes at the
   north (TX) and south (RX) ends.
   Connect power to all Cell Monitoring Units (CMUs) with the alligator clips.
   Wait for the current to fall to less than 0.020 A. No LEDs should be lit.
2) Unplug the red probe of the Fluke 87 III from the white socket, and for each CMU,
   use it to check the voltage at JTAG+ (the rightmost hole of the group of 4).
   They should all read between 2.47 and 2.53 V. Put probe back in white socket.
3) Use the netbook's taskbar (bottom of screen) to choose the icon that looks
   like a spanner and screwdriver (IAR Workbench).
   Use the "Launchpad" programming device to program each CMU in turn,
   by inserting its 4 pin plug part way into the group of 4 holes on the CMU,
   red side furthest from square pad, and tilting it and applying some pressure.
   In IAR Workbench type <Alt+p>wd
   (or choose menu "Project/Download/Download active program").
   Wait for it to complete before moving to the next CMU. If there is an error,
   you may need to unplug the USB connector, wait a few seconds and replug it.
4) Use the netbook's taskbar (bottom of screen) to choose the icon that looks like
   a computer with a "VT" on its screen (TeraTerm). 
   Reset all the CMUs by typing leftAlt+B. 
   Clip the oscilloscope probe alligator 
   clip to the negative bolt on the test jig. Press the oscilloscope probe tip
   against the southwest pin of the part marked (OP1) in the southeast corner of each CMU.
   Hold down the <Shift>+U keys to send auto-repeated U characters and observe
   approximate square waves with some rounded corners.
   The first CMU will be closer to 50/50 hi/lo as it is not being driven by a previous CMU.
   Apart from that, they should all look the same.
   The blue and yellow-green LEDs should all be lit.
5) Type <Ctrl-s>1i<Enter><Ctrl-q> to set the IDs. You will see ---i where --- is 
   one more than the number in the string.
   Type u <Enter> to save the IDs.
   Type v<enter> to check that the last ID is correct (the number of CMUs in the string).``
6) Type 1Q1e<Enter>. All the red LEDs should all come on. Type 0e<Enter> to turn them
    off.

<page break>

7) For each CMU:
  a) Type <n>x<enter> where <n> is the number of the CMU, to address the CMU on its own.
     Don't worry if <n> doesn't show.
  b) Use 1e <enter> to simulate an error. Only the red LED for the current CMU should light.
     If not, <escape><enter> and re-do the x command.
  c) Type 0Q<Enter>. The beeper should sound. Type 1Q0e<Enter> to turn off the beeper and
    red LED. 
  d) Use both probes of the Fluke 87 III multimeter to measure the voltage directly 
     at the CMU's + and - terminals pads.
     If calibrating a BMU, ensure the same voltage is present on the HAZ BAT and HAZ
     ARR inputs.
     Use the v<nnnn>'vc command to calibrate the voltage based on the multimeter reading.
     Check that the first two characters after the '$' are 80 or 7F.
     Check the voltage reading by typing vv<Enter> (ignore the first response).
  e) Use the t<nn>'tc command to calibrate the temperature based on a reading of the
     microcontroller (U1) with the non-contact thermometer. Check with tt command.
  f) Type l'lc<Enter> (ell tick ell cee) to calibrate the bolt- input. The calibration value should be
    less than 10 or greater than 245.
  g) Use 1y to turn on bypass. Supply current should go to 0.4 to 0.7 amps. An amber LED
     should light. Turn it off with 0y<Enter>.
  h) Use u<enter> to turn off bypass and update the calibration values.
     The u is very important otherwise all the above work will be lost. 
     Be sure you see the 'u' echoed.
  i) Type the <ESC> key (upper left corner of keyboard).
     This cancels the previous <n>x command.
  j) Go back to the start of step 7 until all CMUs are done.

8) Test break-to-reset with 1e then <leftAlt-b> (send break). All red LEDs should go off.
9) Test for false break-to-reset with 1Q1e<Enter> then use TeraTerm's Send File command
   in binary mode and with no delays between characters, to send the file
   "Documents/EV/LyteFyba/trunk/PCB/NullsTest.txt". All red LEDs should stay on.
10) Test for excessive quiescent current by ensuring all LEDs are off and removing
   an alligator clip from each CMU in turn and inserting a multimeter on 300 mA range.
   The quiescent current (after supercap has charged) should be between 1.4 and 2.1 mA.
   (was less than 1.0 mA for pre-rev 61 CMUs). Disconnect comms from the last CMU as
   the Novus device may be pumping up the supply.
11) Load Monitor or monolith or wmonolith.
12) First disconnect the CMU board from the test jig, then turn off the power supply.
