List of single-character commands implemented in either the cell-monitor or the debugger or both.

In ASCII order:

--------------------------------------------
` ` characterLiteral
a a ADCValue (r(A)wVoltage)

d d Decimal output
e e ErrorLED

  g Get byte (fetch)
h h Hex output
  i set(I)D

k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]
l l LinkVoltage
m m e(M)itCharacter
n n emit(N)um

p p PrettyPrint
q   QueryWorstBadness
  r ReadCalValue
s s Select
t t Temperature

  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)
  z Ztore byte (store)
{   resetWorstBadness :-{

} }
~ ~ change-sign (postfix negate)
<DEL> (Debugger only: internal hex set)
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode

In logical groupings:

v v cell(V)oltage
l l LinkVoltage
t t Temperature

  i set(I)D
s s Select
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
<DEL> (Debugger only: internal set hex)
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
| | exit or comment
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]

b   BadnessAutonomy was a(U)tonomous
q   QueryWorstBadness
{   resetWorstBadness :-{

  g Get byte  (fetch)
  z Ztore byte (store)

  r ReadCalValue
  w WriteCalValue
  c Calibrate
  u UpdateInfoFlash

} }

In addition, the following character literals have the following meaning when used as an address
parameter to a Read, Write or Calibrate command in the BSL-writer.

`v cell(V)oltage
`l LinkVoltage
`t Temperature
`f Frequency (Four MHz)
`o OneMHz
`i ID

The last 3 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.
