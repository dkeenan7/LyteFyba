To add a third (software) UART for the voice synthesiser we use GEAR_3 (pin 28) for RX and GEAR_4 (pin 10) for TX. But we don't want the 12 volt inverters that are on those (the voice synth will give and take 3V3 signals) so we isolate the inverter outputs by desoldering the 100k resistors R42 and R46. Then we cut the tracks between DC37 pin 28 and R40 and between DC37 pin 10 and R44. Then we jumper from the DC37 pin 28 track to the processor side of R42 (removed), and from the DC37 pin 10 track to the processor side of R46 (removed).

------------------------------
The pulldown for IGN_START (R39) and the pullups for FUEL_DOOR (charge cable) (R47) and GEAR_2 (crash switch) (R36) need to have 1k resistors soldered in parallel with the existing 10k to avoid spurious triggering by noise in drive mode.

------------------------------
Here is the procedure for modifying a Tritium Driver Controls Unit to read the voltage of its nominally 12 V supply (the auxiliary battery) instead of the reversing light current.

Cut U10 pin 4, replace R20 with 160k (0603 or 0805 SMD) and put a (leaded) 820k from U10 pin 6 to the ungrounded side of R20.

Here is the procedure for modifying a Tritium Driver Controls Unit to bring two async serial ports out on Industrial Fiber Optic (IFO) connectors. See 'DCU IFO mods.jpg'.

The MSP430F247 processor pins for UART0 have already been reserved (pins 32 & 33), but to access UART1 (pins 34 & 35) we need to reassign the front-panel red and green LEDs to the unused pins 42 & 43.

To switch the front-panel LEDS from port 3 to port 4:

On the component side
* Cut the two tracks from processor pins 34 & 35 to J3 (the front panel header). 
Cut them just on the front-panel side of the pin 33 via.
* Grind some solder mask off the tracks on both sides of the cuts, but do it in a staggered manner so that no two bare copper patches are side by side.
* Wire from processor pin 42 to the track to the front-panel header pin 2 (was from proc pin 34.
* Wire from processor pin 43 to the track to the front-panel header pin 3 (was from proc pin 35.

At the RXD inputs we use a 680R pullup on the BMS input and 2k2 on the charger input, 
to be pulled down by the collectors ofphototransistors (PTs) of the black IFO receivers
The charger has less current drive to the LED of its blue fibre-optic emitter, hence the larger pullup resistor 
on the receiver. 
The pullups go to a 3V3 supply taken from pin 2 of the JTAG connector J4.
The PT emitters connect to the nearest ground plane.

At the TXD outputs we use 47R resistors in series with the outputs, 
for driving the LEDs of blue IFO emitters.
The LED anodes connect to the 3V3 supply taken from pin 2 of the JTAG connector J4.
The LED cathodes connect to the 47R resistors.

To connect the RXD inputs:

* Wire from the proc pin 33 via to the collector of the IFO phototransistor for the charger.
* Wire from the proc pin 35 track to the collector of the IFO phototransistor for the BMS.

To connect the TXD outputs:

* Wire from the proc pin 32 via to the 47R resistor for the IFO LED for the charger.
* Wire from the proc pin 34 track to the 47R resistor for the IFO LED for the BMS.
