<XON> Resume echoing
: : characterLiteral (same as single-quote)
<   minimum, precede with 'v for voltage, 't for temp or 'p for stress (pain), 'q' for worstStress
>   maximum, precede with 'v for voltage, 't for temp or 'p for stress (pain), 'q' for worstStress

x x e(x)clusive   (single-BMU interaction mode)
X X e(X)clude     (single-BMU ignore mode)
<ESC> ESCape from e(x)clusive or e(X)cluded modes
\ \ exit or comment
k   chec(K)summing, kk to turn checksumming off, k to turn it on (irrespective of current state)
K   KillStatusSending, 1K to kill status sending, 0K to restore it

q   QueryWorstStress (monitor only. 'q' is Pee(Q)Word in TestICal)
{   resetWorstStress :-{

R R query the Reset log. $A = RST pin (break), $6 = power on, $3 = watchdog, $2 = other bad stuff or JTAG
^ ^ resetResetLog

  j JumpToSubroutine (call) [disabled to save space]
  Z Ztore byte (poke byte)
  g Get byte   (peek byte)
  O St(O)re word (poke word) [disabled to save space]
  q Pee(Q)Word (peek word) (TestICal only. 'q' is QueryWorstStress in monitor)

  f FrequencyBurst (between TX- and JTAG-, 182.5 to 183.5 kHz at 20 degC, 185 to 186 kHz at 35 degC)

  r ReadCalValue (TestICal only. 'r' is RxState in monitor)
  w WriteCalValue
  c Calibrate
  u UpdateInfoFlash

In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a ReadCalValue, WriteCalValue
or Calibrate command in TestICal.

'v cell(V)oltage
't Temperature
'l LinkVoltage
'f Frequency (DCO 8 MHz)
'i ID

The last 2 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.

The first 2, along with 'p for stress (pain), are also valid parameters for the max '>' and
min '<' commands.
