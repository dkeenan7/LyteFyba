List of single-character commands implemented in either the monitor or TestICal or both.

In ASCII/alphabetical order:

M T
o '

i a
t l Name or description
--------------------------------------------
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
' ' characterLiteral
- - change-sign (postfix negate)
  a ADCScaled or r(A)wVoltage (TestICal only)
  c Calibrate
d d Decimal output
e e ErrorLED
  f FrequencyBurst (puts MCLK/22 = 182.5 - 183.5 kHz on TX+, TX- and activity LED)
f   FreezingIsStress, '1f' to include undertemperature as stress, '0f' to ignore it
  g Get byte (peek byte)
h h Hex output
  i set(I)Ds
  j JumpToSubroutine (call)
K   KillStatusSending, '1K' to kill status sending, '0K' to restore it
k   chec(K)summing, 'kk' to Kill checKsumming, 'k' to turn on checKsumming (irresp. of current state)
l l LinkVoltage
m m e(M)itCharacter
n n emit(N)um
  o Change Octave of piezo alarm
  O StOre wOrd (poke wOrd) [disabled to save space]
p   Stress level (Pain) (local to each BMU)
  p ParallelPullDown (when testing with BMUs paralleled on power supply)
  q Pee(Q)Word (peek word) (TestICal only. 'q' is QueryWorstStress in monitor)
q   QueryWorstStress (monitor only. 'q' is Pee(Q)Word in TestICal)
  r ReadCalValue (TestICal only. 'r' is RxState in monitor)
r 	RxState (monitor only. 'r' is ReadCalValue in TestICal)
s s Select
t t Temperature
  u UpdateInfoFlash
v v cell(V)oltage
  w WriteCalValue
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)
  Z Ztore byte (poke byte)
  z send nulls (send (Z)eros)
{   resetWorstStress :-{
\ \ exit or comment

In logical groupings:

M T
o '
n c
i a
t l Name or description
--------------------------------------------
' ' characterLiteral
m m e(M)itCharacter
  z send nulls (send (Z)eros)

$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
d d Decimal output
h h Hex output
- - change-sign (postfix negate)
n n emit(N)um       was e(M)itDec

e e ErrorLED
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)

  a ADCScaled or r(A)wVoltage (TestICal only)
  p ParallelPullDown (when testing with BMUs paralleled on power supply)
v v cell(V)oltage
l l LinkVoltage
t t Temperature
r 	RxState (monitor only. 'r' is ReadCalValue in TestICal)
p   Stress level (Pain) (local to each BMU)
f   FreezingIsStress, '1f' to include undertemperature as stress, '0f' to ignore it

  i set(I)Ds
s s Select
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
\ \ exit or comment
k   chec(K)summing, kk to turn checksumming off, k to turn it on (irrespective of current state)
K   KillStatusSending, 1K to kill status sending, 0K to restore it

q   QueryWorstStress (monitor only. 'q' is Pee(Q)Word in TestICal)
{   resetWorstStress :-{

R   queryResetLog
^   resetResetLog

  j JumpToSubroutine (call) [disabled to save space]
  Z Ztore byte (poke byte)
  g Get byte   (peek byte)
  O St(O)re word (poke word) [disabled to save space]
  q Pee(Q)Word (peek word) (TestICal only. 'q' is QueryWorstStress in monitor)

  f FrequencyBurst (puts MCLK/22 = 181.5 kHz on TX+, TX- and activity LED)

  r ReadCalValue (TestICal only. 'r' is RxState in monitor)
  w WriteCalValue
  c Calibrate
  u UpdateInfoFlash

In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a ReadCalValue, WriteCalValue
or Calibrate command in TestICal.

'v cell(V)oltage
'l LinkVoltage
't Temperature
'f Frequency (DCO 8 MHz)
'i ID

The last 2 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.
