List of single-character commands implemented in either the monitor or the debugger or both.

In ASCII order:

M D
o e
n b
i u
t g Name or description
--------------------------------------------
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
' ' characterLiteral
` ` characterLiteral
a a ADCValue (r(A)wVoltage)
b   BadnessAutonomy
  c Calibrate
d d Decimal output
e e ErrorLED
f f
  g Get byte (peek)
h h Hex output
  i set(I)Ds
j j
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]
l l LinkVoltage
m m e(M)itCharacter
n n emit(N)um
o o
p p PrettyPrint
q   QueryWorstBadness
  r ReadCalValue
s s Select
t t Temperature
  u UpdateInfoFlash
v v cell(V)oltage
  w WriteCalValue
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)
  z Ztore byte (poke)
{   resetWorstBadness :-{
| | exit or comment
} }
~ ~ change-sign (postfix negate)
<DEL> (not to be typed. '$' is converted to <DEL> internally)

In logical groupings:

M D
o e
n b
i u
t g Name or description
--------------------------------------------
' ' characterLiteral
` ` characterLiteral
m m e(M)itCharacter

$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
<DEL> (not to be typed. '$' is converted to <DEL> internally)
d d Decimal output
h h Hex output
~ ~ change-sign (postfix negate)
n n emit(N)um       was e(M)itDec
p p PrettyPrint

e e ErrorLED
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)

a a ADCValue (r(A)w voltage)
v v cell(V)oltage
l l LinkVoltage
t t Temperature

  i set(I)Ds
s s Select
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
| | exit or comment
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]

b   BadnessAutonomy was a(U)tonomous
q   QueryWorstBadness
{   resetWorstBadness :-{

  g Get byte   (peek)
  z Ztore byte (poke)

  r ReadCalValue
  w WriteCalValue
  c Calibrate
  u UpdateInfoFlash

f f (unused but related to "Frequency" below)
j j (unused)
o o (unused but related to "OneMHz" below)
} } (unused)

In addition, the following character literals have the following meaning when used as an address
parameter to a Read, Write or Calibrate command in the debugger.

`v cell(V)oltage
`l LinkVoltage
`t Temperature
`f Frequency (Four MHz)
`o OneMHz
`i ID

The last 3 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.
