   w  WriteCalValue
   c  Calibrate
   u  UpdateInfoFlash

In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a ReadCalValue, WriteCalValue
or Calibrate command in TestICal.

'v cell (v)oltage
't Temperature
'l Link voltage
'g fuel (g)auge
'f Frequency (DCO 8 MHz)
'i ID
The last 2 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.

The first 2, along with 'p for stress (pain), are also valid parameters for the max '>' and
min '<' commands.
