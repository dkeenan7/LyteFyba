In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a ReadCalValue, WriteCalValue
or Calibrate command in TestICal.

'I Bolt-/Shuntx20 voltage scale factor
's Temperature vs ADC-value slope
'O Bolt+/Array voltage offset
'o Cell/Battery voltage offset
'c Battery capacity in tenths of an amp hour (only used by BMU)
'r Cell internal resistance in uR (average battery IR for BMU)
'V Bolt+/Array voltage scale factor
'v Cell/Battery voltage scale factor
't Temperature offset
'n Bolt-/Shuntx20 voltage offset
'a ADC timing index
'i ID
The last 1 currently has no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning it could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.

'v and 't, along with 'p for stress (pain), are also valid parameters for the max '>' and
min '<' commands.

In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a QueryManValue command in TestICal.

'g ADC gain factor
'o ADC offset
'r 1.5 V reference scale factor
'3 30 degC ADC value
'8 85 degC ADC value
