List of single-character commands implemented in either the monitor or the debugger or both.

In ASCII order:

M D
o e
n b
i u
t g Name or description
--------------------------------------------
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
' ' characterLiteral
K   KillBadnessSending (toggle)
` ` characterLiteral (not to be typed. Single-quote ' is converted to grave ` internally)
a a ADCValue (r(A)wVoltage)
b   Badness (local to each BMU)
  c Calibrate (debugger only)
c   CommsState (monitor only)
d d Decimal output
e e ErrorLED
  f Fetch word (peek word)
  g Get byte (peek byte)
h h Hex output
  i set(I)Ds
  j JumpToSubroutine (call)
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]
l l LinkVoltage
m m e(M)itCharacter
n n emit(N)um
  o StOre wOrd (pOke wOrd)
p p ParallelPullDown (when testing with BMUs paralleled on power supply)
q   QueryWorstBadness
  r ReadCalValue
s s Select
t t Temperature
  u UpdateInfoFlash
v v cell(V)oltage
  w WriteCalValue
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)
  z Ztore byte (poke byte)
{   resetWorstBadness :-{
| | exit or comment
}   KillBadnessSending (not to be typed. 'K' is converted to '}' internally)
~ ~ change-sign (postfix negate)
<DEL> (not to be typed. '$' is converted to <DEL> internally)

In logical groupings:

M D
o e
n b
i u
t g Name or description
--------------------------------------------
' ' characterLiteral
m m e(M)itCharacter

$ $ dollarHex (set number input mode to hex for next literal)
d d Decimal output
h h Hex output
~ ~ change-sign (postfix negate)
n n emit(N)um       was e(M)itDec

e e ErrorLED
  y b(Y)pass (Yellow)

a a ADCValue (r(A)w voltage)
p p ParallelPullDown (when testing with BMUs paralleled on power supply)
v v cell(V)oltage
l l LinkVoltage
t t Temperature
c 	CommsState (monitor only. 'c' is calibrate in debugger)
b   Badness

  i set(I)Ds
s s Select
x x e(X)clusive     (singleBMU interaction mode)
<ESC> ESCape from eXclusive mode
| | exit or comment
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]
K   KillBadnessSending (toggle)

q   QueryWorstBadness
{   resetWorstBadness :-{

  f Fetch word (peek word)
  g Get byte   (peek byte)
  o StOre wOrd (pOke wOrd)
  z Ztore byte (poke byte)
  j JumpToSubroutine (call)

  r ReadCalValue
  w WriteCalValue
  c Calibrate (debugger only. 'c' is commsState in monitor)
  u UpdateInfoFlash

In addition, the following character literals (character preceded by a single-quote)
have the following meaning when used as an address parameter to a ReadCalValue, WriteCalValue
or Calibrate command in the debugger.

'v cell(V)oltage
'l LinkVoltage
't Temperature
'f Frequency (Four MHz)
'o OneMHz
'i ID

The last 3 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.
