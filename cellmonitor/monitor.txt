List of single-character commands implemented in either the cell-monitor or the BSL-writer or both.

In ASCII order:

` ` characterLiteral
a   ADCValue (r(A)wVoltage) was rawV(O)ltage
b   BadnessAutonomy was a(U)tonomous
  c Calibrate      was cali(B)rate but that was only for link voltage
d d Decimal
e e ErrorLED       was error(L)ED
  f Frequency (FourMHz) (10 second burst on errorLED)
  g Get (fetch)
h h Hex
  i set(I)D
j j jumpFence (temporary debugging command) was Fence
k k chec(K)sum toggle [type twice, in a packet of its own, to Kill chec(K)sum]
l   LinkVoltage     was li(N)kVoltage
m m e(M)itCharacter was EmitCharacter
n n emit(N)um       was e(M)itDec
  o OneMHz              (10 second burst on errorLED)

  u UpdateInfoFlash

j j jumpFence (temporary debugging command) was Fence
} }
<DEL>

In addition, the following character literals have the following meaning when used as an address
parameter to a Read, Write or Calibrate command in the BSL-writer.

`v cell(V)oltage
`l LinkVoltage
`t Temperature
`f Frequency (Four MHz)
`o OneMHz
`i ID

The last 3 currently have no meaning for the Calibrate command, as any meaning they could be given
at present would be equivalent to either the character as a command in itself, or a Write command
with that character as address parameter.
