This project now requires Visual Studio 2015 or later; Community Edition (free
download) is fine. Note that this project uses Microsoft Foundation Classes
(MFC), which are now considered non-mainstream, so you have to do a custom
install and chose MFC as an install option. You do NOT have to choose a
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

To reproduce the distributed executable and to save disk space, choose the
Release solution configuration (Degug is default). It comes after the toolbar
graphical buttons (icons) on a standard installation.
